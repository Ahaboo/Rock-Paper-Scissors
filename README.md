# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Installation
- Download Python 3.11.5
- Run `pip install mediapipe`
- Run `pip install numpy`

### Idea
I created this project to help me get a better understanding on gesture recognition and networking, I found videos online of people using mediapipe and taking different approaches to get a game of rock, paper, scissors working with hand recognition. I wanted to take this one step further by making it so two players can play against each other using hand recognition


### Usage
- Change IP and Port, change IP to localhost if testing on same machine
- Run `python player1.py` on host
- Run `python player2.py` on client joining
- Hand gesture recognition from player1 will be recognized and displayed for player2

### Demo

In progress, Player1's gesture is displayed with text on Player2's screen
